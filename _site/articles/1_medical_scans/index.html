<h1>Medical Scans</h1>
<p>This chapter serves as a introduction to the concepts of medical scans. The bread and butter of our thesis as the source of input data.</p>
<h2>CT Scans</h2>
<dl>
<dt>CT scan</dt>
<dd>computed tomography scan</dd>
</dl>
<p>In this section we will look at the fundamentals of ct scans. As our primary source of data it is important to get a sense of the historical motivation behind the technology and the science that drove it.</p>
<p>We will briefly cover its beginnings, advances and the current state-of-art solutions that maximize the quality of the resulting scan but at the same time minimize the exposure to radiation. Then, briefly, we will examine the physics and mathematics behind the process of acquiring and processing ct scans so that a full and informative picture can be made as to where our sources come from.</p>
