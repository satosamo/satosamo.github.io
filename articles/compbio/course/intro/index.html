    <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This blog accompanies the course, which covers fundamental concepts in molecular biology, algorithms, and machine learning relevant to computational biology. The course includes topics such as genome sequencing and assembly, gene finding, sequence alignment, evolutionary models, phylogenetic trees, comparative and population genomics, RNA structure, motif discovery, gene expression analysis, and protein structure and function. Selected current topics in the field are also included.</p>
<p>Students in computer science–oriented study programs will focus primarily on computational methods and mathematical modeling of these problems.</p>
<p>The purpose of this blog is to provide basic information, summaries, and supporting materials related to the topics discussed in the course.</p>
