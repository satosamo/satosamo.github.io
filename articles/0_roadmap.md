# Castle Building Roadmap

## Overview
A high-level, phase-driven roadmap for planning and executing a castle construction project. Adapt the timelines, resources and deliverables to your scope (historical reconstruction, fantasy build, real-world fortified manor, etc.).

## Vision & Objectives
- Primary vision: Build a durable, functional castle that meets safety, aesthetic and program requirements.
- Objectives:
    - Structural integrity and longevity
    - Defensible layout (if applicable)
    - Period-appropriate aesthetics / chosen style
    - Visitor access and safety
    - Budget and schedule adherence

## Success Criteria
- Structural inspection passed
- Key spaces (keep, great hall, gatehouse, towers) functional and approved
- Systems (water, drainage, basic utilities) operational
- Final budget within agreed variance
- Handover documentation and maintenance plan complete

---

## Phases & High-Level Timeline
1. Concept & Feasibility — 2–6 weeks
2. Site Survey & Permits — 4–12 weeks (parallel tasks possible)
3. Schematic & Detailed Design — 8–16 weeks
4. Site Preparation & Foundations — 4–12 weeks
5. Superstructure (walls, towers) — 12–36 weeks
6. Roof, Floors & Openings — 8–20 weeks
7. Interiors & Systems — 8–20 weeks
8. Defenses, Landscaping & External Works — 6–16 weeks
9. Commissioning & Inspections — 2–6 weeks
10. Handover & Maintenance Setup — 2–4 weeks

(Adjust durations according to scale and resources.)

---

## Example Milestones
- M1: Feasibility report approved
- M2: Planning permission granted
- M3: Foundation completed and inspected
- M4: External walls closed / weather-tight
- M5: Roof complete
- M6: Systems commissioned
- M7: Final inspection passed
- M8: Handover complete

Each milestone should include acceptance criteria, owner, target date, and required documents.

---

## Roles & Responsibilities
- Project Sponsor — funding and strategic decisions
- Project Manager — schedule, budget, coordination
- Lead Architect / Historian — design and authenticity
- Structural Engineer — foundations and load-bearing elements
- Site Manager / Contractor — daily site operations
- MEP Engineer — utilities and systems
- Safety Officer — site safety and compliance
- QA / Inspector — quality checks and sign-offs

---

## Resource Plan
- Materials: stone/brick, lime mortar, timber, metalwork, roofing materials
- Equipment: excavation, scaffolding, lifting equipment
- Labor: masons, carpenters, laborers, specialists
- Consultants: archaeologist (if needed), conservation specialist, planners
- Budget categories: design, permits, materials, labor, contingencies, professional fees

---

## Risk Register (sample entries)
- Ground conditions worse than expected — mitigant: pre-construction geotechnical survey, contingency budget
- Permit delays — mitigant: early engagement with authorities, buffer in schedule
- Material shortages / price increases — mitigant: early procurement, alternate suppliers
- Weather impacts — mitigant: phased scheduling, temporary weather protection

---

## Deliverables per Phase
- Concept: vision statement, feasibility study, preliminary cost estimate
- Design: schematic plans, detailed drawings, structural calculations, specification
- Construction: daily logs, inspection reports, material certificates
- Commissioning: system test reports, safety certificates
- Handover: as-built drawings, O&M manuals, maintenance schedule

---

## Communication Plan
- Weekly site report (to stakeholders)
- Bi-weekly progress meeting (project team)
- Monthly executive summary (sponsor)
- Change control process: log changes, impact assessment, formal approval

---

## Acceptance Checklist (before Handover)
- Structural certificate obtained
- Fire & life-safety checks passed
- Utilities functional (water, power where applicable)
- Drainage and erosion control verified
- Accessibility / paths inspected
- As-built drawings and documentation delivered

---

## Maintenance & Lifecycle
- Routine inspections (annual)
- Masonry repointing schedule (as required)
- Roof and drainage maintenance (bi-annual)
- Record-keeping for repairs and conservation

---

## Templates & Notes
- Milestone template: Title, Owner, Target date, Acceptance criteria, Status
- Task template: ID, Description, Assignee, Start/End, Dependencies, Estimate, Status
- Change request template: ID, Description, Impact (schedule/budget/scope), Decision
